Adaptive (directional) consistency solves bounded-induced-width networks
backtrack-free — the cyclic / width-k generalization of the tree case.

`Ste.ConsistencyTree` mechanized the width-1 instance of Freuder's
classical tractability theorem (`freuder1982backtrack`): a directionally
arc-consistent TREE is solved greedily, no backtracking.  There every
non-root node `i.succ` had a SINGLE earlier neighbour `parent i`.  This
file removes the single-parent restriction: node `i.succ` now carries a
whole SEPARATOR `sep i : Finset (Fin (n + 1))` of earlier neighbours —
the parent set of the node in the induced (fill-in) graph of an
elimination order — and one BUCKET constraint `R i` that reads exactly
the coordinates `sep i ∪ {i.succ}`.

**Why this is the cyclic case.**  A constraint CYCLE numbered along any
elimination order necessarily produces a node with TWO earlier
neighbours (close the cycle: the last node of the cycle sees both the
next-to-last node and, through the chord created by elimination, the
first).  Width 1 (`|sep i| ≤ 1`, `sepWidthLE_singleton`) is exactly the
forest case of `Ste.ConsistencyTree`; `|sep i| ≥ 2` is what cyclic
primal graphs generate, and `w = max |sep i|` is the INDUCED WIDTH
(treewidth along the chosen order) of the network.  Directional
consistency of the buckets — Dechter's adaptive consistency, Freuder's
strong (w+1)-consistency restricted to the order — then yields a
backtrack-free solution, for ANY induced width.  This is the
`k ≥ 2` / cyclic generalization left as outlook in `Ste.Consistency`
and `Ste.ConsistencyTree`.

**The model.**  Nodes `Fin (n + 1)`, domains `D u : Set α`.  For each
`i : Fin n` the bucket of node `i.succ` consists of

* a separator `sep i : Finset (Fin (n + 1))` with
  `hsep : ∀ u ∈ sep i, u.val ≤ i.val` — all separator members precede
  `i.succ` (topological / elimination numbering), and
* a bucket constraint `R i : (Fin (n + 1) → α) → Prop` together with the
  dependence hypothesis `SepSupported sep R`: `R i` gives the same
  verdict on assignments that agree on `sep i` and at `i.succ` — the
  constraint genuinely has scope `sep i ∪ {i.succ}`.

Main notions and results:

* `AdaptiveSolution D R f`: `f` picks a value in every domain and
  satisfies every bucket constraint; `adaptiveSet` is the solution set
  and `adaptiveSet_eq_feasibilitySet` exhibits it as a `feasibilitySet`
  of `Ste.Basic` — the bucket network is an instance of the repo-wide
  constraint formalism.
* `DirectionalConsistent D R`: for every domain-respecting assignment
  of the earlier variables, node `i.succ` has a domain value making its
  bucket constraint true.  With `|sep i| ≤ w` this is directional
  (w+1)-consistency along the elimination order — the output condition
  of Dechter's adaptive-consistency algorithm (`dechter2003constraint`,
  ch. 4) and of Freuder's width/consistency theorem
  (`freuder1982backtrack`).
* `PrefixConsistent D R`: the a-priori stronger variant that conditions
  only on the variables up to `i` (later coordinates unconstrained) —
  Dechter's actual definition; `DirectionalConsistent.prefixConsistent`
  recovers it from `DirectionalConsistent` when all domains are
  nonempty, using the dependence hypothesis to discard the junk at the
  later coordinates.
* `prefixConsistent_solvable_from` (the greedy engine): a prefix-
  consistent network extends any root value `a ∈ D 0` to a global
  solution.  Nodes are assigned in increasing index order — all of
  `sep i` precedes `i.succ` by `hsep`, so when `i.succ` is reached its
  separator is fully assigned and consistency hands over a compatible
  value; no assignment is ever retracted.  The induction peels the last
  node `Fin.snoc`-style exactly as in `Ste.ConsistencyTree`; the
  dependence hypothesis (in the derived prefix form `PrefixSupported`)
  is what makes the truncation well-formed: `R i` cannot see the
  deleted last coordinate.
* `directionalConsistent_solvable_from` / `directionalConsistent_solvable`
  (**adaptive-consistency theorem, bounded induced width**): a nonempty
  directionally-consistent bucket network has a global solution, indeed
  one through any prescribed root value.
* Specializations: `treeArcConsistent_solvable_of_adaptive` re-derives
  the tree theorem of `Ste.ConsistencyTree` via `sep i = {parent i}`
  (width 1, `sepWidthLE_singleton`), and `twoParent_solvable` is the
  first properly cyclic instance — two earlier neighbours
  `sep i = {p i, q i}` (width ≤ 2, `sepWidthLE_pair`), which covers
  every triangulated cycle.

**Honest scope.**  (1) `DirectionalConsistent` quantifies over fully
domain-respecting assignments, so an empty later domain makes it
vacuous while destroying solvability; the solvability theorems for it
therefore assume all domains nonempty (`hne`), unlike the tree file
where the root sufficed — with the stronger `PrefixConsistent` the root
value alone suffices (`prefixConsistent_solvable_from`), which is the
faithful analogue of the tree statement.  (2) This file proves the
DECISION/construction half — consistency implies solvability.  That
adaptive consistency can be ENFORCED by bucket elimination in time
exponential only in `w` (the algorithmic half of `dechter2003constraint`)
is not modelled.  (3) Backtrack-freeness is stated at the root; the
"every value of every node" version needs both orientations, as in the
tree file.

domain and satisfies every bucket constraint.  Bucket `i : Fin n`

/-! ### Scope: separator dependence and induced width -/

/-- **Separator dependence**: the bucket constraint `R i` has scope
`sep i ∪ {i.succ}` — it gives the same verdict on any two assignments
that agree on the separator and at the node itself.  This is the clean
formulation of "`R i` is a constraint over the variables
`sep i ∪ {i.succ}`" for constraints presented on whole assignments. -/

    (∀ u ∈ sep i, g u = g' u) → g i.succ = g' i.succ → (R i g ↔ R i g')

/-- **Prefix dependence**: `R i` depends only on the coordinates
`≤ i + 1`.  This is what the greedy induction actually consumes; by
`SepSupported.prefixSupported` it follows from separator dependence
plus the topological-order hypothesis on the separators. -/
def PrefixSupported {n : ℕ} (R : Fin n → (Fin (n + 1) → α) → Prop) : Prop :=

    (∀ u : Fin (n + 1), u.val ≤ i.val + 1 → g u = g' u) → (R i g ↔ R i g')

/-- Separator dependence plus topologically ordered separators
(`∀ u ∈ sep i, u.val ≤ i.val`) yields prefix dependence: everything
`R i` can see lives at coordinates `≤ i + 1`. -/

/-- **Induced-width bound**: every separator has at most `w` members.
`w = 1` is the forest case of `Ste.ConsistencyTree`; `w ≥ 2` is where
cyclic primal graphs live, and in general `w` is the induced width
(treewidth along the elimination order) of the network. -/

/-! ### Directional consistency -/

/-- **Directional consistency** of the buckets along the elimination
order: for every domain-respecting assignment `g`, node `i.succ` has a
domain value `c` making its bucket constraint true once `c` is written
into the assignment.  Since `R i` only reads `sep i ∪ {i.succ}` and
`|sep i| ≤ w`, this is directional (w+1)-consistency — the condition
established by Dechter's adaptive-consistency / bucket-elimination
procedure (`dechter2003constraint`, ch. 4), and the order-restricted
form of Freuder's strong (w+1)-consistency (`freuder1982backtrack`). -/
def DirectionalConsistent {n : ℕ} (D : Fin (n + 1) → Set α)
    (R : Fin n → (Fin (n + 1) → α) → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ i : Fin n, ∀ g : Fin (n + 1) → α, (∀ u, g u ∈ D u) →
    ∃ c ∈ D i.succ, R i (Function.update g i.succ c)

/-- **Prefix consistency**: like `DirectionalConsistent`, but the
assignment `g` need respect the domains only at the coordinates `≤ i` —
the variables already assigned when the greedy sweep reaches `i.succ`.
This is Dechter's directional consistency verbatim (consistency
relative to the EARLIER variables); it is the hypothesis the greedy
engine consumes, and it is implied by `DirectionalConsistent` on
nonempty domains (`DirectionalConsistent.prefixConsistent`). -/
def PrefixConsistent {n : ℕ} (D : Fin (n + 1) → Set α)
    (R : Fin n → (Fin (n + 1) → α) → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ i : Fin n, ∀ g : Fin (n + 1) → α,
    (∀ u : Fin (n + 1), u.val ≤ i.val → g u ∈ D u) →
    ∃ c ∈ D i.succ, R i (Function.update g i.succ c)

/-- On nonempty domains, directional consistency upgrades to prefix
consistency: pad the unassigned later coordinates with arbitrary domain
values, and use prefix dependence to discard the padding again. -/

Peeling the last node: with prefix dependence no bucket of the

/-! ### Backtrack-free search on the bucket network -/

/-- **The greedy engine** (`freuder1982backtrack`,
`dechter2003constraint`): on a prefix-consistent bucket network, any
root value `a ∈ D 0` extends to a global solution through `a`.  Nodes
are assigned in increasing index order; when node `i.succ` is reached
its separator is already assigned (all members precede it), and prefix
consistency supplies a compatible domain value — no assignment is ever
retracted.  The induction peels the last node as in
`Ste.ConsistencyTree`, with prefix dependence (`hdep`) certifying that
the surviving buckets cannot see the deleted coordinate.  Note that
only the ROOT domain is required nonempty — the faithful analogue of
the tree statement. -/

/-! ### The first properly cyclic case: two earlier neighbours

A node with TWO earlier neighbours is what a cycle produces under any
elimination order (the elimination fill-in closes the cycle into
triangles).  `sep i = {p i, q i}` with a ternary bucket constraint is
therefore the smallest genuinely cyclic — width-2 — instance, out of
reach of the tree formalism. -/

/-- **Backtrack-free search on width-2 (cyclic) networks**: a nonempty
network in which each node `i.succ` has two earlier neighbours
`p i, q i` and a directionally consistent ternary bucket constraint
`R i` admits a global solution.  Instantiating `p`/`q` along a
triangulated cycle solves cyclic constraint graphs — the case
`k = 3` (strong 3-consistency ⇒ width 2 solvable) of
`freuder1982backtrack`. -/
